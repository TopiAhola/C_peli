Daily log:

Day 1: 24.5.2025
Daily 1. Start. Testing windows message box. Done.
Daily 2. Had to specify ANSI versions of functions... Will be problem in the future?


Day 2: 25.5.2025
Windows libraries have problems. Have to set the compiler up manually with bat file...
"undefined reference to `__imp_PatBlt' collect2.exe: error: ld returned 1 exit status"


Day 3: 26.5.2025
Figured out how to link libraries to the compiler. Also how to edit the powershell command in VSCode.
No progress with the code, but solving compiler problem was great.


Day 4: 27.6.2025
Daily 3 done. 
Learned #define
Bitmaps and backbuffer functions are complicated. No bugs?


Day 5: 28.6.2025
Created a bitmap draw function. Changed GetMessage to PeekMessage to allow 
program loop without messages. This seems to loop too fast.
Added a static variable to draw_test() instead. Works.


Day 6: 30.5.2025
Animation on resize works but not while looping... Daily 5 not started


Day 7: 2.6.2025
Animation during main program loop works :) Daily 5, change bitmap related functions to use a pointer instead of a global variable for bitmap.
resize_dib_section segfaults... Because pointer was null. (missing &variable) Works now!
Replaced GetClientRect() calls with get_window_dimensions()


Day 8: 3.6.2025
Gamepad input. Random macro-function-as-type-pointer-shit. Doesn't crash. Daily 6 half done.


Day 9: 4.6.2025
Daily 6 completed. draw_test() takes keyboard input to animate the bitmap.


Day 10: 5.6.2025
Directsound buffers set. Secondary buffer doesn't work. Maybe something to do with buffer size? Need to replace with XAudio anyway.


Day 11: 6.6.2025
Daily 8 was fun. Heap corruption error. Needs debugging.


Day 12: 8.6.2025
aly 8 works. Error was passing a pointer insted of pointer to pointer to soundbuffer Lock().


Day13:
