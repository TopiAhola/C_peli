Daily log:

Day 1: 24.5.2025
Daily 1. Start. Testing windows message box. Done.
Daily 2. Had to specify ANSI versions of functions... Will be problem in the future?


Day 2: 25.5.2025
Windows libraries have problems. Have to set the compiler up manually with bat file...
"undefined reference to `__imp_PatBlt' collect2.exe: error: ld returned 1 exit status"


Day 3: 26.5.2025
Figured out how to link libraries to the compiler. Also how to edit the powershell command in VSCode.
No progress with the code, but solving compiler problem was great.


Day 4: 27.6.2025
Daily 3 done. 
Learned #define
Bitmaps and backbuffer functions are complicated. No bugs?


Day 5: 28.6.2025
Created a bitmap draw function. Changed GetMessage to PeekMessage to allow 
program loop without messages. This seems to loop too fast.
Added a static variable to draw_test() instead. Works.


Day6:
break


Day7:
break


Day 8: 30.5.2025
Animation on resize works but not while looping... Daily 5 not started


Day 9: 31.5.2025
